# 💼 PayPredictor – Employee Salary Prediction using Machine Learning Algorithms

A Streamlit-based web application that predicts whether an employee's salary exceeds $50K/year based on various demographic and employment features. This project evaluates multiple machine learning models and deploys the best one for public use.

## 📌 Overview

**PayPredictor** is an intelligent machine learning system designed to predict an individual's income class (`>50K` or `<=50K`) based on input features such as age, education, occupation, and working hours. The model is trained on the UCI Adult dataset and deployed using **Streamlit Cloud**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Build and train classification models for salary prediction.
- Compare multiple algorithms to identify the best performer.
- Deploy the best model with a user-friendly web interface.

---

## 📊 Algorithms Used

The following machine learning algorithms were trained and evaluated:

- **CatBoostClassifier**  
  > Gradient boosting on decision trees with built-in handling of categorical features.  
  ✅ *Best performing model in this project.*

- **LightGBMClassifier**  
  > Fast and efficient gradient boosting framework by Microsoft.

- **Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)**  
  > A generative probabilistic model with Gaussian assumptions.

- **ExtraTreesClassifier**  
  > An ensemble learning method based on randomized decision trees.
